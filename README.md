# Default Seed Repo for Project

Welcome to your project Repo. 

## Branches

Your repo is initiated with 3 branches `dev` `test` and `main`. The `dev` branch is used to deploy within the development account, `test` branch for the test account and `main` branch for production. It is recomended to develop in feature branches and merge into one of the 3 branches when you are ready to deploy your changes into the AWS account.

## Pipeline Automation.

Some more instructions will go here. TBD
